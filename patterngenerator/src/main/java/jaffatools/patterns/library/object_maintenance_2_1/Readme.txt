The object_maintenance_2_1 pattern has the following features
=============================================================
- Surrounds individual widgets with Property tags

TODO for a future version of object_maintenance pattern
=======================================================
- Support the action 'Add New' in a maintenance screen. This will save the current changes and bring up a blank screen to add a new record
- Support cases where an object cannot be persisted unless the record(s) in a related component are entered
- Support AutoGenerated fields


Migrating from object_maintenance_2_0 to object_maintenance_2_1
===============================================================



Known Limitations
=================

For In-line one-to-one relationships only
-----------------------------------------
- Related objects don't support dirty-reads. 
  Even if your inner object supports a time stamp <StampType>LastUpdatedDateTime</StampType>,
  it will not support the use of the <UseForDirtyReadCheck>true</UseForDirtyReadCheck>.
  

- Related objects don't impact the time stamps of the parent record. 
  If you update a field on a related one-to-one object and save it, as you have not updated
  the primary object, the primary objects time stamp is not effected. You can have independent
  time stamps on the related object.
